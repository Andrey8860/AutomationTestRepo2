I get on with life as a air traffic controller,
I'm an optimistic kinda person.
I like tasting wine on Sundays,
I like frying ants in the week.
I like to contemplate pizza.
But when I start to daydream,sdfdsfdsf
My mind turns straight to pies.

Oh oh oh!

Do I love pies more than pizza?
Do I love pies more than pizza?

I like to use words like 'jiggle,'
I like to use words like 'juicy.'
I like to use words about pizza.
But when I stop my talking,
My mind turns straight to pies.

Oh oh oh!

Do I love pies more than pizza?
Do I love pies more than pizza?

I like to hang out with Jason,
I like to kick back with Will,
But when left alone,
My mind turns straight to pies.

Oh oh oh!

Do I love pies more than pizza?
Do I love pies more than pizza?

I'm not too fond of dangerous driving,
I really hate washing dishes,
But I just think back to pies,
And I'm happy once again.

Oh oh oh!
